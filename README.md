# DynamicCollections
3D Web Platform of Archaeological Artefacts designed for Data Reuse and Deep Interaction


#To Do
- [ ] add 'zoom to' hotspot behaviour (see autoload template)
- [ ] add 'next' hotspot feature
- [ ] add save measurements similar to annotations (e.g. GOM like callipers)
- [ ] highlight which hotspot is which on mouseover (see auto load tempalte)
- [ ] tighten up bounding box (currently over estimate)
- [ ] remove paradata title, this information is still just metadata (description of data)
- [ ] update with modifications from current BiTFROST installation and test
- [ ] modify naming and categories structure to better fit needs of database (e.g. remove 'MUSEUM' field requirements)
- [ ] check/implement axis orientation handling
- [ ] implement look up from unimus api?
